          <p className="about-text">
            I am a passionate software developer with a keen interest in
            creating efficient and elegant solutions. My journey in programming
            started with competitive programming, which helped me develop strong
            problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            Currently, I'm focusing on web development and system design, always
            looking to learn new technologies and best practices. I believe in
            writing clean, maintainable code and creating user-friendly
            applications. I have developed significant intelligence in
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and hope to make
            significant progress in the same over the next few months.
